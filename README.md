# Radium OS

I thought it would be a cool idea to build an OS, so I started this side project.
My initial goal was to create a basic operating system. It should be able to read and write files, connect to the internet, have audio and video and be able to execute programs.

I didn't get around to figuring out how to execute binaries, and since I currently don't have enough time, I don't think this will ever be added. Maybe I'll do it later but for now I'm happy with everything that I learned from this project.

## Getting Started
